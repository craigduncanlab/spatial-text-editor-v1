# Demo 

This is a demonstration markdown file that can be loaded into the editor.

// Notes for the demonstration markdown

The visual editor means that someone does not need to 'know' markdown to get the idea, and they can still convert their work to markdown if needed.

## Lower level heading

# Next markdown

## Subheading

This will be captured as a separate box.

Each box is reduced to a single hashed heading when opened in the editor, plus it adds the notes function so that you can record notes.

Filtering out the notes lines should be easy.

Alternatively, you can format the notes as code e.g. ```

# Final markdown

This should be the third box in the display.

Your presentation layout is relatively easy.

You can type it up as if it is a script.

By including additional meta-data inside the markdown, you can then ingest it and do things with it, not just render it on screen.

If you have data-related markdown, then it can be ingested as a separate type of box in the editor.
