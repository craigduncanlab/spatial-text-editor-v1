#- Demo 

This is a demonstration markdown file that can be loaded into the editor.

The minus sign next to the heading hash #- means 'not visible'.

This is 'stateful markdown'.

// In-line notes for notes that appear near the markdown text but by default do not appear in Export md.

The visual editor means that someone does not need to 'know' markdown to get the idea, and they can still convert their work to markdown if needed.

This is a re-purposing of standard markdown to make it easier to work on components of traditional word processing documents, on the assumption that we want to include some meta-data and state changes with our markdown.

## Lower level heading

/* Multi-line notes that appear with each block, in the 'Notes' section of the editor. */

Alternatively, you can format the multi-line notes as code e.g. 
```
Multi-line notes
```

# Box 2

## Subheading

This will be captured as a separate box.

Each box is reduced to a single hashed heading when opened in the editor, plus it adds the notes function so that you can record notes.

Filtering out the notes lines should be easy.


# Final markdown

This should be the third box in the display.

Your presentation layout is relatively easy.

You can type it up as if it is a script.

By including additional meta-data inside the markdown, you can then ingest it and do things with it, not just render it on screen.

If you have data-related markdown, then it can be ingested as a separate type of box in the editor.
